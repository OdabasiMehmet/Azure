The global infrastructure of Azure is based on geographies, regions and data centers.

Geographies are actually the countries. each country may have a specific requirement for a data center so having different geographies allow Azure to comply with national regulations.

In each geography, there exists several regions. These regions are distrubuted across the geographies to house data centers.

Data centers are the actual buildings that host physical infrastructure, such as the computers.

Datacenters: A data center is a physical building that houses all the hardware necessary that make up Azure resources. The datacenters are secured and only people with credentials
may enter the buildings. The data centers have their own isolated power supplies, dedicated networks and backup power generators. These back up systems make sure that Azure is 
fault tolerant.
