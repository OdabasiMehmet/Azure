The global infrastructure of Azure is based on geographies, regions and data centers.

Geographies are actually the countries. each country may have a specific requirement for a data center so having different geographies allow Azure to comply with national regulations.

In each geography, there exists several regions. These regions are distrubuted across the geographies to house data centers.

Data centers are the actual buildings that host physical infrastructure, such as the computers.
