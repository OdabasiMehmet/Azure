Type of Cloud Services:

1. Infrastructure as a Service
   This tyoe of cloud offers users the necessary infrastructure to run, such as computers, networks, and storage. Users are able to create and run applications, but they also need to
manage the infrastructure as well. For example, if the application receives too many traffic, the user is responsible for scaling up the infrastructure to mee the needs. Also, if the
application reauires a more powerful computer, the user needs to increate the compute power of the infrastructure.
  In this cloud service type, the user and the cloud provider share the responsibility over the infrastructure. Although the user has more control over the infrastructure, they also
have more responsibility on the infrastructure.
  In Azure, an example to IaaS is Azure virtual machines.
